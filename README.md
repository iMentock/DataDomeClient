# Demo application for Data Dome
Demonstrates an example client side application that calls a private API. 

## Instructions
1. Clone the repo
2. Install the dependencies
3. Run 'start' script

### Note:
Ensure you change the Axios calls to point to either your locally hosted mock API or the hosted repo at https://data-dome-module.herokuapp.com
You will also need to create your own Auth0 application and create a .env file with your applications credentials (domain, client_id, audience, and scope)

If you wish to see a working demo of this application visit -> https://data-dome-client.herokuapp.com/
